# Istio Multicluster Examples

This repository contains examples of Istio multicluster deployments. The examples are designed to demonstrate various configurations and use cases for deploying Istio across multiple Kubernetes clusters. To apply these examples you will need to have Istio installed in your clusters and the `istioctl` command available. You can use this repo (link) to configure EKS cluster with Istio.

To deploy thes examples, you can use this cdk stack to create the clusters and deploy Istio in them. The stack is designed to be used with AWS CDK and can be customized to fit your needs. [Using CDK To Deploy K8s with istio](https://github.com/gumonet/cdk-k8s-with-istio)
