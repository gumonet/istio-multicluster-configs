# Istio Multicluster Examples

This repository contains examples of Istio multicluster deployments. The examples are designed to demonstrate various configurations and use cases for deploying Istio across multiple Kubernetes clusters. To apply these examples you will need to have Istio installed in your clusters and the `istioctl` command available. You can use this repo (link) to configure EKS cluster with Istio.
